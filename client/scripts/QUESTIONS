INIT
  what is init doing (same as $(document).ready(){})
  how to construct a promise

how to make an async call without callbacks
  when we fetch messages it takes a delay to receive messages
  data/messages/ajax object is return with success?
  how do we wait for data to finish being received/loading before moving on to other functions/tasks (AKA promises --- .then, .done, ??????)
